# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
Problem Statement: Predict price of used cars. 

Use Case: This Project can be used by car dealers or companies like CARS24 & SPINNY to predict used     car prices and understand the key factors involved in the same.

INPUT Features: Make, Model, Type, Origin, DriveTrain, Invoice, EngineSize, Cylinders, HorsePower, MPG_City, MPG_Highway, Weight, Wheelbase and Lenght.

OUTPUT Feature: MSRP(Price)

Concepts Used: Exploratory Data Analysis (like removing missing values, replacing characters, etc), Data Cleaning, Data Visualisation (using Matplotlib,  Seaborn and Plotly), Univariate analysis, Bivariate analysis, Multivariate analysis, One-Hot Encoding, Feature dropping, Train/Test Split, Training and Evaluating M.L algorithms: XGBoost, Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression and Decision Tree.

Conclusion: XGBoost model scores 94% accuracy which clearly outperforms the Multiple Linear Regression(84%), Decision Tree(88%) and Random Forest Regression(84%) models. 

NOTE: In this project, plotly library has been used to create interactive charts to have a better analysis of various features. On uploading the same notebook (containing intercative charts) here, Github has hidden those visualisations. Kindly look into the pdf format to find the charts used for the analysis.
